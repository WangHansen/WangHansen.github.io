					<p>This is the second version of my personal website, <a href="#">click here</a> for the first one. Compared with the old one, the new one looks more beautiful, every background picture was selected with exterme caution and the web itself was designed to be simplier and more user-friendly. Also, one big change is that the new one used bootstrap framework which makes it more compatiable with the mobile device given the fact that more and more people are surfing the internet through their phones and tables</p>

					<p>This is an Android app that can detect touch event and track the distance between touch point and the edge of the screen and display this number in terms of centimeters. The number can be stored and uploaded to social network such as Facebook through one click to encourage competition through its social integration. The idea behind this Android application was generated from a popular trend I happened to notice on social network named " <a href="#">extreme phone piniching</a>". My friend and I worked 48 hours straight and made the app as part of hackerthan_Enghack. I designed the user interface and the functions of the app.</p>

					<p>Stock simulation provides people with little or no background a easy tool to learn how stock trading works. Anyone can register for a new account coming with some amount of initial money. Stocks are predefined and so is the news which can influence the price of the stocks. Users are able to sell and buy any amount of predefined stocks at any point during the simulation they wish. All the databases are simulated by textfiles. This software was coded by Java and run on Windows system. I led a team of four people working on this software as part of school projects. I designed and coded the main functions, user interfaces and the algorithem that can store information of users' accounts into textfiles or pull them out. </p>
